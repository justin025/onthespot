## 1. Install Through Prebuilt Releases (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started.

1. **Download the Latest Release**

   - Visit our [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/justin025/onthespot/releases).
   - Look for the latest version suitable for your operating system:
     - **Windows Users**: Download the `.exe` file.
     - **MacOS Users**: Download the `.dmg` file associated with your mac (x86_64 for intel, arm64 for apple silicone).
     - **Linux Users**: Download the `.AppImage` or `tar.gz` file.

2. **Install OnTheSpot**

   - **Windows**: Run the downloaded `.exe`.
   - **MacOS**: Open the `.dmg`, follow the instructions listed in README.txt, and drag `OnTheSpot.app` into your `Applications` folder.
   - **Linux**: Make the `.AppImage` executable and run it, alternatively extract the tar.gz and execute the binary.

> [!TIP]
> For MacOS, if you encounter security warnings, right-click the app and select "Open" from the context menu to bypass the gatekeeper.

3. **Launch OnTheSpot**

   - Open the application from your Downloads folder or Applications menu.
